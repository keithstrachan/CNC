# Print NC Mini Mods


This is a set of files that i've used to be able to create my own PrintNC Mini.

I needed to leverage equipment i already have available so as to reduce the expenses with creating the Print NC Mini. As an example, I have handy, Nema24 stepper motors, the design calls for Nema17, and there is a variant created by HelmusMkII on the discord for Nema23 (https://discord.com/channels/648972213734604807/1096702157396385845/1096702157396385845). 

Leveraging some of the thinking that others have put into their iterations, and also noting some of their feedback on their own design, i've made this compilation of adjustments to suit my own build.

If you are similarly inspired, and wish to build you own Print NC mini, i strongly encourage you to:

1. Join the discord server and peruse the various areas and research - https://discord.gg/RxzPna6
2. purchase the design files from the designer, Mark, from the website:  https://printncmini.com
   it is a small cost in reality, and encourages Mark to continue with his fabulous work.
3. Research, research and research some more. Don't go in with an expectation that you will have something working in a month, your build will come down to many factors, but don't be discouraged to have a go.
4. There is a wiki for the main Print NC which will provide a great amount of additional information - https://wiki.printnc.info/en/home
5. If you're not comfortable or don't have access to equipment to create some of the parts (3D Printer etc) you may find people selling components on the discord within the marketplace section.

There are many wonderful people on the discord who are happy to answer questions, and offer suggestions where needed.
Please understand that these people volunteer their information to you, just like I am by making this repo available.
No warranty implied to you using anything I have created. I'm providing these as examples for you, showing you how I did mine. Do your research, or buy an already made CNC machine.
