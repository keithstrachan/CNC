My CNC work I'm willing to share

In this repo, you will find various designs, pdf's, BOMs, STL files etc
Some of these i have borrowed from other people, under their GPL licenses or open source where applicable.
I've tried as best i can to ensure that i've not breached anyones I.P.

to me a CNC machine, is anything that uses computer numerical control to achieve a result, motion, additive or subtractive machining. This includes CMC Lathes, CNC Mills, 3D Printers, Laser engravers, robots etc. You may believe that 3d Printers for example aren't CNC machines, but as a person who has written code for these machines, they are most certainly CNC machines - typically called CNC FDM.
